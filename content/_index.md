# What is Kreato Linux?
Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability.

It is inspired from projects such as KISS Linux, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Its main mission is to be tinkerer's Linux(R) distribution.

# Features

## Modular core
Kreato Linux's modular building tools allow you to mix-and-match components and create your own unique setup.

## Jumpstart
Jumpstart is Kreato Linux's default init system, written in Nim. It allows as much modularity as possible to the user, while being minimal and easy-to-use.

Jumpstart is inspired from init systems such as systemd.

## Source/Binary hybrid package manager
Kreato Linux uses kpkg, a package manager written in Nim that gives you the choice of building or installing binaries. This way you can choose what's best for your usecase.

## Good documentation
Kreato Linux uses manpages for its documentation. A wiki is also available. Manpages are constantly updated and the code has lots of comments to make you understand what is going on.

Wiki is available [Here](https://wiki.linux.kreato.dev).

## Independent
Kreato Linux is independent and is maintained by a single person. This means the functions of the distribution is made as easy to maintain as possible.
