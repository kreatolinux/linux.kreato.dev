# What is Kreato Linux?
Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability.

It is inspired from projects such as KISS Linux and Gentoo.

# Features

## Modular core
Kreato Linux's modular building tools allow you to mix-and-match components and create your own unique setup.

## Source/Binary hybrid package manager
Kreato Linux uses nyaa, a package manager written in Nim that gives you the choice of building or installing binaries. This way you can choose what's best for your computer. Nyaa is also really minimal.

## Good documentation
Kreato Linux uses manpages for its documentation. A wiki is also coming soon. Manpages are constantly updated and the code has lots of comments to make you understand what is going on.
